# Backend Structure Document Workflow

This workflow guides you through understanding and implementing the backend architecture of the Samudra Paket ERP system, focusing on microservices, API design, and data flow.

## Steps to Follow

1. Review the microservice architecture overview:
   - API Gateway pattern
   - Service boundaries and responsibilities
   - Inter-service communication patterns

2. Understand the hexagonal architecture implementation for each microservice:
   - API Layer (Controllers, Routes, Validators)
   - Application Layer (Use Cases, Services)
   - Domain Layer (Entities, Value Objects, Domain Services)
   - Infrastructure Layer (Repositories, External Services)

3. Study the database design and data access patterns:
   - MongoDB schema design
   - Repository pattern implementation
   - Data validation strategies

4. Examine the authentication and authorization framework:
   - JWT implementation
   - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
   - API security measures

5. Understand the event-driven architecture components:
   - Message broker configuration
   - Event producers and consumers
   - Asynchronous processing patterns
